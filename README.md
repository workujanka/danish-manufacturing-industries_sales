# Danish Manufacturing Industries – Exploratory Data Analysis

## 📖 Project Overview
This repository contains an exploratory analysis of Danish manufacturing industries using data retrieved from [Statbank.dk](https://www.statbank.dk), the official statistical database of Statistics Denmark.  
The project was undertaken **solely for practice purposes** as part of a data analysis course. It demonstrates workflows in **MySQL**, **Power BI**, and **Excel** for cleaning, querying, and visualizing industry turnover data.

⚠️ **Important Disclaimer**:  
This is a **personal learning project**. It should **not** be regarded as a deeply thought or professionally performed work, and therefore must **not** be used as a reliable source for research, policy, or business decisions.

## 📈 Key Results
Three main visualizations were produced:
1. **Annual Turnover Share by Industry (2023)** – Pharmaceuticals dominate with 23% of turnover, followed by engines/windmills/pumps and chemicals.  
2. **Yearly Total Turnover Trend (2000–2023)** – Long-term growth with a dip in 2009 (financial crisis) and sharp rise post-2021.  
3. **Top Industries by Turnover (2023)** – Pharmaceuticals lead by a wide margin, with machinery and chemicals also significant.
